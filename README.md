# Payload E-Commerce Template

This is the official [Payload E-Commerce Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/templates/ecommerce). Use it to power e-commerce businesses and online stores of all sizes. This repo includes a fully-working backend, enterprise-grade admin panel, and a beautifully designed, production-ready website.

This template is right for you if you are selling:

- Physical products like clothing or merchandise
- Digital assets like ebooks or videos
- Access to content like courses or premium articles

Core features:

- [Pre-configured Payload Config](#how-it-works)
- [Authentication](#users-authentication)
- [Access Control](#access-control)
- [Shopping Cart](#shopping-cart)
- [Checkout](#checkout)
- [Paywall](#paywall)
- [Layout Builder](#layout-builder)
- [SEO](#seo)
- [Website](#website)


## Website

This template includes a beautifully designed, production-ready front-end built with the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org), served right alongside your Payload app in a single Express server. This makes is so that you can deploy both apps simultaneously and host them together. If you prefer a different front-end framework, this pattern works for any framework that supports a custom server. If you prefer to host your website separately from Payload, you can easily [Eject](#eject) the front-end out from this template to swap in your own, or to use it as a standalone CMS. For more details, see the official [Custom Server Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/custom-server).

### Cache

Although Next.js includes a robust set of caching strategies out of the box, Payload Cloud proxies and caches all files through Cloudflare using the [Official Cloud Plugin](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-cloud). This means that Next.js caching is not needed and is disabled by default. If you are hosting your app outside of Payload Cloud, you can easily reenable the Next.js caching mechanisms by removing the `no-store` directive from all fetch requests in `./src/app/_api` and then removing all instances of `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` from pages files, such as `./src/app/(pages)/[slug]/page.tsx`. For more details, see the official [Next.js Caching Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching).

### Eject

If you prefer another front-end framework or would like to use Payload as a standalone CMS, you can easily eject the front-end from this template. To eject, simply run `yarn eject`. This will uninstall all Next.js related dependencies and delete all files and folders related to the Next.js front-end. It also removes all custom routing from your `server.ts` file and updates your `eslintrc.js`.

> Note: Your eject script may not work as expected if you've made significant modifications to your project. If you run into any issues, compare your project's dependencies and file structure with this template. See [./src/eject](./src/eject) for full details.

For more details on how setup a custom server, see the official [Custom Server Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/custom-server).

##  Development

To spin up this example locally, follow the [Quick Start](#quick-start). Then [Connect Stripe](#connect-stripe) to enable payments, and [Seed](#seed) the database with a few products and pages.

### Docker

Alternatively, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to spin up this template locally. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Follow [steps 1 and 2 from above](#development), the docker-compose file will automatically use the `.env` file in your project root
1. Next run `docker-compose up`
1. Follow [steps 4 and 5 from above](#development) to login and create your first admin user

That's it! The Docker instance will help you get up and running quickly while also standardizing the development environment across your teams.

### Seed

To seed the database with a few products and pages you can run `yarn seed`. This template also comes with a `GET /api/seed` endpoint you can use to seed the database from the admin panel.

> NOTICE: seeding the database is destructive because it drops your current database to populate a fresh one from the seed template. Only run this command if you are starting a new project or can afford to lose your current data.

## Production

To run Payload in production, you need to build and serve the Admin panel. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Invoke the `payload build` script by running `yarn build` or `npm run build` in your project root. This creates a `./build` directory with a production-ready admin bundle.
1. Finally run `yarn serve` or `npm run serve` to run Node in production and serve Payload from the `./build` directory.
1. When you're ready to go live, see [Deployment](#deployment) for more details.

### Deployment

Before deploying your app, you need to:

1. Switch [your Stripe account to live mode](https://stripe.com/docs/test-mode) and update your [Stripe API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys). See [Connect Stripe](#connect-stripe) for more details.
1. Ensure your app builds and serves in production. See [Production](#production) for more details.

The easiest way to deploy your project is to use [Payload Cloud](https://payloadcms.com/new/import), a one-click hosting solution to deploy production-ready instances of your Payload apps directly from your GitHub repo. You can also deploy your app manually, check out the [deployment documentation](https://payloadcms.com/docs/production/deployment) for full details.
